# Headwater Crafthouse React/Typescript

---
---
#### This objective of this project is to parse the Json file and filter the data depending on order, category with React-Typescript.
---
---
#### Setup
---
npm install

npm start

---

### Extra information
This project has react-bootstrap dependency's for the dropdown button. 

If you notice any key issues in the console - developer tools on chrome, they shouldn't affect the project but will need to be addressed in later commits.

I made this project to help me get into the mindset of a React developer and use typescript.
